<h2>Low Level Language</h2>
<p>Low-level languages provide no abstraction over computer hardware and allow direct control over the computer's resources.</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Provides direct control over the computer's hardware and resources.</li>
    <li>Program written is machine-dependent, making it non-portable and difficult to write.</li>
    <li>Programs written in low-level language run faster.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Types</h3>

<h4>Machine Language (1GL)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Consists of binary numbers (1 and 0).</li>
    <li>Directly understood by the processor.</li>
    <li>No language translator is required.</li>
    <li>Faster execution speed and efficient use of hardware.</li>
    <li>Difficult to develop and debug programs.</li>
    <li>Program written is machine-dependent.</li>
    <li>Requires a deeper understanding of hardware architecture.</li>
    <li>Operation codes and memory addresses must be remembered.</li>
    <li>Highly prone to errors.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Assembly Language (2GL)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Uses symbolic instructions like ADD, SUB, DIV, etc.</li>
    <li>Assembler converts assembly code to machine code (source code to object code).</li>
    <li>Easier to develop and debug programs compared to machine language.</li>
    <li>Faster execution of code and efficient use of hardware components than high-level languages.</li>
    <li>Useful for developing hardware-oriented software like device drivers and robotics.</li>
    <li>Not directly understood by the computer; needs an assembler for translation.</li>
    <li>Program written is machine-dependent.</li>
    <li>Requires a deeper understanding of hardware architecture.</li>
    <li>Highly prone to errors.</li>

<h2>Operators</h2>
<p>Operators are symbols used to perform operations on operands (values or variables).</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Operand:</strong> A quantity on which an operation is performed (e.g., in 7 - 2, both 7 and 2 are operands).</li>
    <li><strong>Operator:</strong> A symbol that represents an operation (e.g., in 7 - 2, "-" is the operator indicating subtraction).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Types of Operators:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Arithmetic Operators:</strong> +, -, *, /</li>
    <li><strong>Relational Operators:</strong> >, <, >=, <=</li>
    <li><strong>Logical Operators:</strong> AND, OR, NOT</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operation:</strong> The process of applying an operator to operands (e.g., in 7 - 2, the operation is subtraction, resulting in 5).</p>
<br>

<h2>Errors</h2>
<p>An error is an issue in the code or execution process that prevents a program from functioning as intended.</p>
<h3>Types of Errors</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Syntax Error:</strong> When the code doesn't follow the syntax or writing format of the respective language. <br> Example: Missing semi-colon at the end of a line in C, missing {} in a for loop in JavaScript, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Logical Error:</strong> An error in the program's logic or concept that causes it to operate incorrectly but not terminate abnormally. <br> Example: Using area = length + breadth instead of length * breadth.</li>
	<li><strong>Semantic Error:</strong> Semantic errors happen when the code is syntactically correct but does not work as intended <br> Example: using x = y * z instead of x = y + z when summation is needed</li>
    <li><strong>Runtime Error:</strong> An error that occurs while the program is executing or running. <br> Example: Accessing invalid memory or causing a memory leak.</li>
    <li><strong>Compilation Error:</strong> Issues detected during the translation of source code to machine code. <br> Example: Using undeclared variables, not importing required libraries, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>The set of rules that defines the structure of a programming language. Syntax errors prevent the code from running.</p>
<h3>Semantics</h3>
<p>The meaning or behavior of the code, i.e., what the code does when executed. Semantic errors cause incorrect program output.It is similar to gramatical error in a human language</p>

<h3>Testing</h3><p> The process of evaluating a program to ensure it functions as expected. It involves identifying bugs, errors, or missing requirements before deployment.</p>
<h3>Debugghing</h3><p> The process of finding and fixing the bugs or errors identified during testing or program execution.</p>
<h3>Types of Testing</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Unit Testing:</strong> Testing individual components. Example: Testing a `calculate_sum()` function in isolation.</li>
    <li><strong>Integration Testing:</strong> Testing the interaction between different components. Example: Checking if a payment module works with a shopping cart system.</li>
    <li><strong>System Testing:</strong> Testing the entire system as a whole. Example: Verifying a complete e-commerce website, from user login to payment processing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Program Design Tools</h2>
<h3>Algorithm</h3>
<p>An algorithm is a finite and step-by-step set of statements that solve a particular problem.</p>
<h3>Pseudocode</h3>
<p>Pseudocode is a program design tool that uses English phrases and mathematical statements to explain program flow.</p>
<h3>Flowchart</h3>
<p>A flowchart is a diagrammatic representation of a program flow that represents a sequence of operations to be followed in a particular order.</p>
