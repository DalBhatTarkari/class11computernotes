<h2>Computer System and I/O Devices</h2>
<h3>Components of computer system</h3>
<p><b>Input Unit</B><br> Data and instruction must enter the computer system before any computation can be perform on the supply data. Input device accepts data and instruction from the user, hence the device or the unit which is used to fed raw facts and figures to the computer system  for processing along with set of instruction is called input unit. 
It also converts input data into suitable form that is accepted by the computer System. Generally, it act as a interface/bridge or medium through which communication between user and computer takes place. In short following are the functions performed by the input unit
    <br><br>1. It accepts the list of instruction and data from the outside world.<br>
    2. It converts the supplied instruction and data into computer acceptable form that is binary code.<br> 
    3. It supplies the converted instruction and data to the computer system for further processing.<br><br>
Some of the commonly used input device are:<br>
Keyboard , track pad, touchscreen, mouse, light pen, scanner, BCR, MICR, OCR, joystick ,trackball etc<br><br>

<b>Output Unit</b><br> The job of an output unit is just the reverse of an input unit. It supplies information and result of computation to the outside world. Thus, it links computer with the external environment. It consists of device that translate information processed by the computer into a form that human can understand. The computer processed information consist of Os and 1 which need to be translated into letters, numbers, special symbols, pictures etc that people can understand. In short following are the function performed by an output unit:
    <br>1. It accepts the result produce by the computer which is not understandable to us.<br>
    2. It converts the result into human understandable form.<br>
    3. It supplies the converted results to the outside world.<br><br>
Commonly used output device are:<br>
Monitor, printers, speakers, plotters etc.<br>
    There are two types of output device.<br>
                i.  Hard Copy output: They provide physical output thus the name hardcopy. It may be on paper,cloth,etc. <br>
                ii. Soft Copy output: They provide virtual output thus the name softcopy. It may be via light, sound,etc.<br>
<br><b>Processing Units</b><br>
CPU [Central Processing Unit] is the brain of the computer. It is the part that does most of the work in a computer system. Just like how our brain controls our body and processes information, the CPU carries out instructions from programs and performs calculations. It’s made up of smaller components that work together to execute tasks, making it the heart of any computing device.
<br>
All types of data processing operations from simple arithmetic to complex tasks and all the important functions of a computer are performed by the CPU. It helps input and output devices to communicate with each other and perform their respective operations. It also stores data which is input, intermediate results in between processing, and instructions. The CPU’s job is to make sure everything runs smoothly and efficiently. The following 3 are the parts of processing unit:
<br><b>Memory Unit</b><br>
As the name suggests this unit can store instructions, data, and intermediate results. The memory unit is responsible for transferring information to other units of the computer when needed. It is also known as an internal storage unit or the main memory or the primary storage or Random Access Memory (RAM) as all these are storage devices.
<br>
Its size affects speed, power, and performance. There are two types of memory in the computer, which are primary memory and secondary memory. Some main functions of memory units are listed below:
<br>
Data and instructions are stored in memory units which are required for processing.<br>
It also stores the intermediate results of any calculation or task when they are in process.<br>
The final results of processing are stored in the memory units before these results are released to an output device for giving the output to the user.<br>
All sorts of inputs and outputs are transmitted through the memory unit.<br>
<b>Control Unit</b><br>
As the name suggests, a control unit controls the operations of all parts of the computer but it does not carry out any data processing operations. Executing already stored instructions, It instructs the computer by using the electrical signals to instruct the computer system. It takes instructions from the memory unit and then decodes the instructions after that it executes those instructions. So, it controls the functioning of the computer. Its main task is to maintain the flow of information across the processor. Some main functions of the control unit are listed below:
<br>
Controlling of data and transfer of data and instructions is done by the control unit among other parts of the computer.<br>
The control unit is responsible for managing all the units of the computer.<br>
The main task of the control unit is to obtain the instructions or data that is input from the memory unit, interpret them, and then direct the operation of the computer according to that.<br>
The control unit is responsible for communication with Input and output devices for the transfer of data or results from memory.<br>
The control unit is not responsible for the processing of data or storing data.
<br><b>ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)</b><br> 
ALU is responsible for performing arithmetic and logical functions or operations. It consists of two subsections, which are:
<br>
Arithmetic Section: By arithmetic operations, we mean operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and all these operations and functions are performed by ALU. Also, all the complex operations are done by making repetitive use of the mentioned operations by ALU.<br>
Logic Section: By Logical operations, we mean operations or functions like selecting, comparing, matching, and merging the data, and all these are performed by ALU.
<br>
<br><b>Storage Units</b><br>
A storage unit is a part of the computer system that stores information and instructions to be processed. It is an integral part of the computer hardware. Data quantities and storage units in computers are always given in bytes, with one byte consisting of 8 bits. 

</p>

<h3>Microprocessor</h3>
<p><b>Basic Concepts of Microprocessor</b><br>
A microprocessor is the central unit of a computer system that performs all computational tasks. It is an integrated circuit (IC) that processes instructions and executes tasks like arithmetic, logic operations, and data movement.
<br><br><b>Clock Speed</b><br>
Clock speed determines how fast a microprocessor executes instructions.<br>
Measured in Hertz (Hz) (cycles per second).<br>
Higher clock speed means faster processing.<br>
Common units:<br>
Megahertz (MHz) = 1 million cycles/sec<br>
Gigahertz (GHz) = 1 billion cycles/sec<br>
Example: A 3.5 GHz processor performs 3.5 billion cycles per second.<br>
<br><b>Word Length</b><br>
Word length refers to the number of bits processed at a time by the microprocessor.<br>
Determines the amount of data and memory the processor can handle.<br>
Common word lengths: 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit.<br>
Example: A 32-bit processor processes 32 bits of data in a single cycle.<br><br>

<b>Components of a Microprocessor</b><br>
Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) – Performs arithmetic (addition, subtraction) and logic (AND, OR, NOT) operations.<br>
Control Unit (CU) – Directs data flow, fetches instructions, and manages execution.<br>
Registers – Small storage units inside the CPU for quick data access.<br>
Cache Memory – High-speed memory that stores frequently used data.<br>
Buses (Data, Address, Control) – Transfer data between the processor, memory, and I/O devices.<br><br>
<br><b>Functions of a Microprocessor</b><br>
Fetches instructions from memory.<br>
Decodes instructions to understand operations.<br>
Executes arithmetic and logic operations.<br>
Controls data flow between memory and I/O devices.<br>
Manages system performance through clock and power management.
</p>
<h3>Bus System</h3>
<p>A bus system is a communication pathway that transfers data between different components of a computer, such as the CPU, memory, and input/output (I/O) devices. It consists of a set of parallel wires that carry data, addresses, and control signals.<br>
<br><b>Data Bus</b><br>

Transfers data between the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.<br>
The width (8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit) determines how much data can be transferred at once.<br>
<br><b>Address Bus</b><br>
Carries the memory address of the data or instruction that the CPU needs.<br>
It is unidirectional (CPU to memory/I/O).<br>
The number of lines determines the maximum memory a system can address (e.g., a 32-bit address bus can access 4GB of memory).<br>
<br><b>Control Bus</b><br>
Carries control signals to manage operations (e.g., read/write, interrupt requests).<br>
It helps coordinate communication between components.<br>

</p>


<h3>Primary memory</h3>
<p>Primary memory is the main memory of a computer, which stores data and instructions that the CPU needs immediately. It is faster but volatile, meaning data is lost when power is turned off.
<br>
<br><b>Types of Primary Memory:</b><br><br>
<b>Random Access Memory (RAM)</b><br>

Stores temporary data and instructions for the CPU.<br>
Volatile (data is lost when the system is turned off).<br>
<b>Types:</b><br>
Static RAM (SRAM): Faster, used in cache memory.<br>
Dynamic RAM (DRAM): Slower but widely used as main RAM.<br>


<br><b>Read-Only Memory (ROM)</b><br>

Stores permanent data and instructions for booting the system (BIOS).<br>
Non-volatile (retains data even when powered off).<br>
<b>Types:</b><br>
PROM (Programmable ROM) – Can be programmed once.<br>
EPROM (Erasable PROM) – Can be erased using UV light.<br>
EEPROM (Electrically Erasable PROM) – Can be erased and reprogrammed electronically.<br>
</p>

<h3>Secondary Memory</h3>
<p>Secondary memory is permanent storage, used to store large amounts of data, files, and software. It is non-volatile, meaning data remains even after power is turned off.
<br><br>
<b>Types of Secondary Memory:</b><br><br>
<b>Magnetic Storage:</b><br>
