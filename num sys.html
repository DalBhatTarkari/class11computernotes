<h2>Number system</h2>
<p>The number system or the numeral system is the system of naming or representing numbers. We know that a number is a mathematical value that helps to count or measure objects and it helps in performing various mathematical calculations. There are different types of number systems in Maths like decimal number system, binary number system, octal number system, and hexadecimal number system. In this article, we are going to learn what is a number system in Maths, different types, and conversion procedures with many number system examples in detail. Also, check mathematics for grade 12 here.</p>

    <h3>What is Number System in Maths?</h3>
    <p>A number system is defined as a system of writing to express numbers. It is the mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set by using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner. It provides a unique representation of every number and represents the arithmetic and algebraic structure of the figures. It also allows us to operate arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.</p>
    
    <p>The value of any digit in a number can be determined by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The digit</li>
        <li>Its position in the number</li>
        <li>The base of the number system</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What is a Number?</h3>
    <p>A number is a mathematical value used for counting, measuring, or labeling objects. Numbers are used for performing arithmetic calculations. Examples of numbers are natural numbers, whole numbers, rational and irrational numbers, etc. Zero is also a number that represents a null value.</p>

    <p>A number has many other variations such as even and odd numbers, prime and composite numbers. Even and odd terms are used when a number is divisible by 2 or not, whereas prime and composite differentiate between the numbers that have only two factors and more than two factors, respectively.</p>

    <p>In a number system, these numbers are used as digits. 0 and 1 are the most common digits in the number system, which are used to represent binary numbers. On the other hand, 0 to 9 digits are also used for other number systems. Let us learn here the types of number systems.</p>

    <h3>Types of Number Systems</h3>
    <p>There are various types of number systems in mathematics. The four most common number system types are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Decimal number system (Base- 10)</li>
        <li>Binary number system (Base- 2)</li>
        <li>Octal number system (Base- 8)</li>
        <li>Hexadecimal number system (Base- 16)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Decimal Number System (Base 10 Number System)</h4>
    <p>The decimal number system has a base of 10 because it uses ten digits from 0 to 9. In the decimal number system, the positions successive to the left of the decimal point represent units, tens, hundreds, thousands and so on. This system is expressed in decimal numbers. Every position shows a particular power of the base (10).</p>

    <p>Example of Decimal Number System:</p>
    <p>The decimal number 1457 consists of the digit 7 in the units position, 5 in the tens place, 4 in the hundreds position, and 1 in the thousands place, whose value can be written as:</p>

    <p>(1×10<sup>3</sup>) + (4×10<sup>2</sup>) + (5×10<sup>1</sup>) + (7×10<sup>0</sup>) = 1000 + 400 + 50 + 7 = 1457</p>

    <h4>Binary Number System (Base 2 Number System)</h4>
    <p>The base 2 number system is also known as the Binary number system wherein only two binary digits exist, i.e., 0 and 1. The figures described under this system are known as binary numbers, which are the combination of 0 and 1. For example, 110101 is a binary number.</p>

    <h4>Octal Number System (Base 8 Number System)</h4>
    <p>In the octal number system, the base is 8, and it uses numbers from 0 to 7 to represent numbers. Octal numbers are commonly used in computer applications. Converting an octal number to decimal is the same as decimal conversion and is explained below using an example.</p>

    <p>Example: Convert 215<sub>8</sub> into decimal.</p>

    <p>215<sub>8</sub> = 2 × 8<sup>2</sup> + 1 × 8<sup>1</sup> + 5 × 8<sup>0</sup> = 2 × 64 + 1 × 8 + 5 × 1 = 128 + 8 + 5 = 141<sub>10</sub></p>

    <h4>Hexadecimal Number System (Base 16 Number System)</h4>
    <p>In the hexadecimal system, numbers are written or represented with base 16. In the hexadecimal system, the numbers are first represented just like in the decimal system, i.e. from 0 to 9. Then, the numbers are represented using the alphabet from A to F.</p>

    <p>Hexadecimal: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F</p>

    <h3>Number System Conversion</h3>
    <p>Numbers can be represented in any of the number system categories like binary, decimal, hexadecimal, etc. Also, any number which is represented in any of the number system types can be easily converted to another. Below is an example of conversions:</p>

    <h4>Example of Number System Conversion</h4>
    <p>The number 349 in different number systems is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Binary: 101011101</li>
        <li>Decimal: 349</li>
        <li>Octal: 535</li>
        <li>Hexadecimal: 15D</li>
    </ul>
